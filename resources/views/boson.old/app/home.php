            Under the Hood of <br />
            Boson

        <p>
            Why Boson? Because it's not Electron! And much lighter...
        </p>

        <p>
            Want to know what makes Boson so compact, fast and versatile?
            We don't use Electron or other Chromium instance builds.
            Instead, our solution is based on simple, yet robust and
            up-to-date technologies that provide native performance
            and lightweight across all platforms.
